On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both added:      test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    ../README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

#### It seems there is some conflict needs to be fix and has to update them and commit them and some change has not been stages and committted

```

## Problem Part 2.M

## Problem Part 2.O

```bash

$ git branch -d test1
error: The branch 'test1' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D test1'.


```

## Problem Part 2.P

  test2

```

## Problem Part 2.Q

```bash
#### The different message because when you try to delete test1 inside the test2 you can not be able to do it because
#### test1 and test2 created from master branch so if you want to delete test1 and test2 you have to go to master branch first

## HomeWork number 2

## Question one

The three pillars of science: Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data

## Question two

Three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences

1. a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction (predictive computing).
2. a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available (numerical simulation).
3. a substitute for theory, where it is not available (data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning, â€¦).

## Question Three

The two types of reasoning in Science: Deductive and plausible reasoning

Example of Deductive Reasoning:  
first premise: Noble gases are stable.  
second premise: Neon is a noble gas.  
inference: Therefore, neon is stable.

Example of Plausible Reasoning:

A: It will start to rain by 10 am at the latest.  
B: The sky will become cloudy before 10 am.

if A is true then B is true
B is true
therefore, A become more plausible.

## Question Four

Lets summurize the series of argument first:

So, the first things is the policeman is plausible reasoning becasue as soon policeman heard
burglar alarm that raise the posibility in his mind that there is something suspicious.

1. if A = The burglar alarm
   then B = there is a posibility that burglary has happened.
2. if A = burglar alarm set up and you see a gentlemen is coming through the broken window
   then B = it raises another level of plausiblity that burglar has happened.
3. if A = There is a bag with a gentlemen that has lots of expensive jewelry
   then B = it raises another level of plausibility that burglar has happened.

Therefore, by combined all these argument we can say that it is highly plausible that
this gentlemen is a burglar.
