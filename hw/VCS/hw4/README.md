## Question 1

```bash
the two major types of uncertainty:
1. aleatoric:  cannot reduce uncertainty any further.
2. epistemic: called uncertainty in Bayesian school of thought. can reduce uncertainty with better data / model.
```

## Question 2

```bash
The Normal (Gaussian) distribution is the most naturally-occurring distribution in Nature.
```

## Question 3

```bash
The probability of obtaining a value 1 and 2 in a single experiment of throwing a die is 1/6+1/6 = 1/3 or 33.3%.
```

## Question 4

```bash
The probability of obtaining a value 1 or 2 or larger than 5 in a single experiment of throwing a die is 1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2.
```

## Question 5

```bash
Poisson distribution.
```

## Question 6

```bash
Correlation:Correlation is a statistical concept, typically quantified by a real number between -1 and
1, that represents the amount of co-variation of two random variables with each other.

Correlation does NOT necessitate causation.

For Example: Exercise and skin cancer. There is statistically significant positive correlation
between exercise and cases of skin cancer. However, we can also develop
 a plausible hypothesis: perhaps the stress from exercise causes the body to lose
  some ability to protect against sun damage. Therefore, rates of exercise and skin cancer—were
  affected by a third, causal variable—exposure to sunlight—but they were not causally related.
```

## Question 7

```bash
Yes. Correlation between two variables imply dependence between the two variables.
Example: xercise and skin cancer. There is statistically significant positive correlation between exercise and cases of skin cancer.
```

## Question 8

```bash
aesthetics: All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable
features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features
as aesthetics.
 few aesthetics:
 Position, shape, size, color, line width and line type.
```

## Question 9

```bash
two major classes of aesthetics:
1. Quantitative
2. Qualitative
```

## Question 10

```bash
Continuous data: 1.5,3.5
Discrete data: 1,2,3,4,5
```

## Question 11

```bash
the common name for variables holding data: Quantitative, qualitative, date or time, text.


```

## Question 12

```bash
ordered data: good, fair, poor.
unordered data: dog, cat, fish.
```

## Question 13

```bash
Quantative data represented with the same units and grid size if they are related to each other.
```

## Question 14

```bash
when we have a cordinate that can transform become non perpendicular become flexiable the you can twist them , squize them for better
visualization. For instance, non perpendicular in relatibity where time expension and time dialation shows that transformation these
axes when you gain huge speed the time on your watch is going to be different than who does not have speed at all relative to
your speed. You can show that these kind of differences in time , it is going to be well represent by cordinates that are not perpendicular
to each other. Non perpendicular cooridnate are highly useful in visualization.

```

## Question 15

```bash
Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature, such that data values at one end of the scale can be logically
joined to data values at the other end.

```

## Question 16

```bash
1. Qualitative color scale: to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order such as different countries on a map or     different manufactures of a certain product.

2. Sequential color scale: to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order such as different countries on a map
or different manufacturers of a certain product.

3. Diverging color scale: visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a
 neutral midpoint.One straightforward example is a dataset containing both positive and negative numbers. We may want to show those
with different colors, so that it is immediately obvious whether a value is positive or negative as well as how far in either
direction it deviates from zero.
4. Accent color scales:  color scales that contain both a set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more saturated    colors. specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key information about the story we want to tell, and we
can strengthen the story by emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader. An easy way to achieve this emphasis is
to color these figure elements in a color or set of colors that vividly stand out against the rest of the figure
```

## Question 17

```bash
In this plot it shows that there is some people under the age of zero which is a serious problem in this plot and thats not possible.

```

## Question 18

```bash
The y axes is a logarithmic axes because they are bas ten also the order of the magnitude go higher and lower which means that we are dealing
with logarithmic axes. And the x axes is a non logarithmic axes.

So the exponential mathematical function would be best describe the inital phases in this plot. Even though it looks like linear under
semi logarithmic plot but its actually exponential growth in a regular plot.

The second phases although it looks like linear but the slope of the line looks shallower. So we can tell that we still
have an exponential growth but the exponential growth is not as substantial as rapid as it was in the initial phase.
```

## Question 19

```bash
The second palettes will be more appropriate fro effective visualization for communications with humans because a good fraction of our
society has color blindness that they can not distinguesh the red color and green color. Therefore, the first palettes will not be
a good for effective visualization for communication with human.
