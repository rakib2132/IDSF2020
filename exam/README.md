## Final Exam

## Question 1

```bash
The advantage of switching door, depends on your knowledge about the hostâ€™s decision. Informed Host: Knows where
 the car is and will not open the door that leads to car.When the host opens the door and has a goat in it,
  she or he is transferring a useful knowledge to us about which door might contain the car.
   Therefore, her action is helpful in a way that my chance has increase but still switching
   my door wont help me bacause I still do not know whether i pick the goat door or the
    car door. So, host wont make me benifits just opening one door from out of 10 but
     host transforming useful knowledge that my chance of probability is improved.

## Question 12

```bash
1. Qualitative color scale: to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order
such as different countries on a map or different manufactures of a certain product.

2. Sequential color scale: to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order such as different countries on a map
or different manufacturers of a certain product.

3. Diverging color scale: visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a
 neutral midpoint.One straightforward example is a dataset containing both positive and negative numbers. We may want to show those
with different colors, so that it is immediately obvious whether a value is positive or negative as well as how far in either
direction it deviates from zero.
4. Accent color scales:  color scales that contain both a set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more saturated        colors. specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key information about the story we want to tell, and we
can strengthen the story by emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader. An easy way to achieve this emphasis is
to color these figure elements in a color or set of colors that vividly stand out against the rest of the figure
```

## Question 13
